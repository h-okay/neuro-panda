NeuroPanda is a lightweight and user-friendly Python library that enables you to build, train, and evaluate simple neural networks from scratch. The project aims to provide a clear and accessible implementation of neural networks for beginners and those looking to understand the fundamentals of deep learning.

### Features:

**Easy to Use:** NeuroPanda is designed to be beginner-friendly, with a straightforward API that allows you to quickly create and train neural networks.

**Customizable Architecture:** Build your own neural network by specifying the number of layers, units, and activation functions, allowing you to experiment with various configurations.

**Backpropagation:** NeuroPanda implements the backpropagation algorithm, enabling efficient training of neural networks through gradient descent.

**Activation Functions:** The library includes popular activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh, which can be easily selected for each layer.

**Loss Functions:** You can choose from several loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy to suit your specific use case.
